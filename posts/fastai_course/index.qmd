# Practical Deep Learning for Coders 2022

I am currently working through fast.ai's 2022 course: [Practical deep learning for coders](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2022-07-21-dl-coders-22.html).

## Learning Objectives
- To understand what are current realistic results that can be achieved on my budget and with the amount of data I can access?
- To be able to develop a model and then reuse that model on different systems.
- To be able to solve a problem with fastai that I come up with on my own.
